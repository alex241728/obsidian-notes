# Theorem 1
Any two tape machine running in time $T(n)$ can be simulated by a (standard, one-tape) machine running in time $poly(T(n))$.
## Proof
See notes
# Theorem 2
For any constant $k$, any $k$-tape machine running in time $T(n)$ can be simulated by a (standard) machine running in time $poly(T(n))$.
## Proof
See notes
# Theorem 3
Any RAM machine running in time $T(n)$ can be simulated by a standard machine running in time $poly(T(n))$.
## Proof
