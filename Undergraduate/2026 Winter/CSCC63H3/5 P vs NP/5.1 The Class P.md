Disregard polynomial differences in running time because any of the deterministic computational models are **polynomially equivalent** (Any of them can simulate another with only a polynomial increase in running time).
# Definition
$P$ is the class of languages that are decidable in polynomial time on a deterministic single-tape TM.
$P = \bigcup_{c} TIME[n^c]$
# Importance
1. $P$ is invariant for all models of computation that are polynomial equivalent to the deterministic single-tape TM.
2. $P$ roughly corresponds to the class of problems that are realistically solvable on a computer.
# Outside of the class
- Uncomputable problems
	- DIAG (Diagonalisation)
	- HALT (Halting problem)
	- U (Universal TM)
	- K ($\{\langle M \rangle \mid M \text{ halts on input } \langle M \rangle\}$)
- Hierarchies (more resources $\Rightarrow$ more power)
	- $U_T$ (Time-bounded universal TM)
	- Time-bounded DIAG
